# Ye'ole TODO List

- Environment variables

- Secrets

- update pull to pull all bases

- Clean up docker cache?? Find out why its so fat and slow on dev containers

- Switch to docker outside of docker, better dev container - https://medium.com/@jamiekt/vscode-devcontainer-with-zsh-oh-my-zsh-and-agnoster-theme-8adf884ad9f6

- Error message is wrong for timeout (Error: localhost:8080 took longer than 0 milliseconds to start.)
